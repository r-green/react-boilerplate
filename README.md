# React Boilerplate

This is a work in progress.

---

## About

I put this starter boilerplate app together as I found other starter kits to be overwhelming, when I was first learning React/Redux etc and I wanted to learn
 how to piece everything together for myself.

The following technologies are being used:

* [React](https://github.com/facebook/react)
* [React Router](https://github.com/rackt/react-router)
* [Babel](http://babeljs.io) for ES6 and ES7 magic
* [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io) for bundling
* [Webpack Dev Middleware](http://webpack.github.io/docs/webpack-dev-middleware.html)
* [Webpack Hot Middleware](https://github.com/glenjamin/webpack-hot-middleware)
* [Redux](https://github.com/rackt/redux)'s futuristic [Flux](https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2014/05/06/flux.html) implementation
* [Redux Dev Tools](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-devtools) for next generation DX (developer experience). Watch [Dan Abramov's talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsSnOQynTHs).
